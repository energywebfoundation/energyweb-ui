## About Energy Web Client UI

The Energy Web Client UI (EWF UI) is a User Interface desktop application for the [Parity Ethereum Client](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/master/README.md) >=v1.10. It features a Wallet supporting Ether and ERC-20 Tokens, a contract development environment, and so much more. EWF UI will download and run [Parity Ethereum Client](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/master/README.md) in the background if it is not found on the system. 
By default EWF UI will try connect to Tobalaba using Websocket port 8546. 

## Build from source

```bash
npm install
npm run electron
```

You should see the Electron app popping up.

### Build the binary (Optional)

One further, albeit optional step is to create an OS-spefific binary. This is done with the following command:

```bash
npm run release
```

This command may take some time. Once finished, you will see binaries for your OS in the `dist/` folder.
